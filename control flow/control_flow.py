there are 4 types of control flow
1. sequential - in this we dont need to control
2. conditional  - if, if else, if elif, if elif else
3. iterative/looping - while(infite - time execution increment & decrement is not but for infinite increment and decrement is happen), for(finite-time execution)
4. transfer statement - continue, break, pass(these 3 are keywords)
